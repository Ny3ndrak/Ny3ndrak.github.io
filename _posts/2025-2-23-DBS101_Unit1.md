# Topic : Database Systems Fundamentals

----
## [ Lesson 1]
## Key Concepts
#### Data: 
Collection of facts.

#### Database: 
An organized collection of structured information, typically stored electronically.

#### Database Management System (DBMS):

A collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access that data.

## The purpose of database systems: 
    Database systems are needed to manage collections of data that are highly valuable, relatively large, and
    accessed by multiple users and applications, often simultaneously. They combine various types of data into a unified repository of information.

### Examples of database systems in use at industries     include:

    -Banking and finance for transaction processing and customer information systems

    -Social media

    -Sales

    -Navigation systems

## [Lesson 2]

## Different types of data models used in database design:

### Data Models: 
These are conceptual tools that describe data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints.

### Database languages and their applications:

### Database Languages:
 These are essential for interacting with databases.

#### Data-definition language: 

Used to specify the database schema, domain constraints, referential integrity, and authorization. An example of SQL DDL is creating a table.

#### Data-manipulation language: 

Enables users to access or manipulate data as organized by the appropriate data model. Types of access include retrieval, insertion, deletion, and modification. DMLs can be procedural (specifying what data are needed and how to get them) or declarative/nonprocedural (specifying what data are needed without specifying how to get them). SQL query language is non-procedural. A query is a statement requesting the retrieval of information.


## Fundamentals of  database system architecture and their components:

### Database System Architecture and Components:

#### Database Engine:

 This is a library/software in a DBMS that manages disk storage and performs CRUD operations. It's also called a storage engine or embedded database. Some databases allow changing database engines.

Functional Components of a Database Engine:

▪Storage Manager: 
Provides the interface between the low-level data stored in the database and the application programs and queries submitted to the system.

▪Query Processor: 
Includes a DDL interpreter, DML compiler, and query evaluation engine.

▪Transaction Management: Consists of the concurrency-control manager and the recovery manager.


## Learning Experience:

Reflecting on my journey through learning database fundamentals, it has been a transformative experience in understanding both the technical and conceptual aspects of organizing and managing data. Initially, my view of databases was limited, but this course expanded that understanding by breaking down complex topics into digestible concepts. 
A key area of growth for me has been learning how to design databases effectively. I now feel more confident in approaching database challenges, thinking critically about how to organize, store, and retrieve data efficiently. 

Overall, this experience has not only enhanced my technical skills but also broadened my perspective on the essential role of databases in modern software systems. As I continue to learn, I look forward to applying this knowledge to real-world problems and gaining deeper insights into how data shapes decision-making and system performance.
