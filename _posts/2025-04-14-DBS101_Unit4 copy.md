## [Lesson 9]  
### Key Concepts  

#### **Joins in SQL**  
- **Natural Join**: Combines tables based on common attributes, performs a Cartesian product, and removes inconsistent tuples.  
- **Inner Join**: Returns only matched tuples from both tables. Default join type in SQL.  
- **Outer Join**: Preserves unmatched tuples from one or both tables, filling gaps with `NULL` values.  
  - **Left Join**: Includes all left table rows, matched or not.  
  - **Right Join**: Includes all right table rows, matched or not.  
  - **Full Outer Join**: Includes all rows from both tables.

**Example**:  
```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName  
FROM Orders  
LEFT JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;  
```

#### **SQL Views**  
- Virtual tables derived from query results.  
- Simplify complex queries, enhance security, and customize data presentation.  
- **Materialized Views**: Stored physically and updated automatically when base tables change.  

**Example**:  
```sql
CREATE VIEW swefaculty AS  
SELECT ID, name, deptname  
FROM instructor  
WHERE deptname = 'swe';  
```

#### **Integrity Constraints**  
Rules to maintain data consistency:  
1. **Entity Integrity**: Primary keys cannot be `NULL`.  
2. **Domain Constraints**: Validates data types (e.g., `CHECK(age > 18)`).  
3. **Referential Integrity**: Foreign keys must reference valid primary keys.  
4. **Key Constraints**: Ensures uniqueness of primary/unique keys.

## [Lesson 10]  
### Key Concepts  

#### **Indexes**  
- Data structures to speed up queries on specific columns.  
- **Syntax**:  
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX deptindex ON instructor (deptname);  
  DROP INDEX deptindex;  
  ```

#### **Authorization**  
- Controls access to data via privileges:  
  - `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `REFERENCES` (for foreign keys).  
- **Roles**: Group privileges for easier management.  

**Example**:  
```sql
GRANT SELECT ON department TO Amit WITH GRANT OPTION;  
REVOKE SELECT ON department FROM Amit;  
```

#### **Accessing SQL from Programming Languages**  
- **Dynamic SQL**: Queries constructed at runtime (e.g., JDBC/ODBC).  
- **Embedded SQL**: SQL statements preprocessed into function calls.  

**Example (JDBC)**:  
```java
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:postgresql://localhost/db");  
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();  
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM instructor");  
```

## [Lesson 11]  
### Key Concepts  

#### **Functions vs. Procedures**  
| Feature          | Function                          | Procedure                     |  
|------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|  
| **Return Value** | Always returns a single value.    | May return zero/multiple values. |  
| **Execution**    | Called within `SELECT` statements. | Called explicitly with `CALL`. |  
| **Use Case**     | Calculations (e.g., `SUM()`).     | Business logic (e.g., scheduling). |  

**Function Example**:  
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_patient_appointments(p_patient_id INT)  
RETURNS TABLE (appointment_id INT, date DATE) AS $$  
BEGIN  
  RETURN QUERY SELECT AppointmentID, AppointmentDate FROM Appointment  
  WHERE PatientID = p_patient_id;  
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;  
```

**Procedure Example**:  
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE schedule_appointment(  
  p_patient_id INT, p_doctor_id INT)  
AS $$  
BEGIN  
  INSERT INTO Appointment (...) VALUES (...);  
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;  
```

#### **Triggers**  
- Automatically executed in response to database events (e.g., `INSERT`).  
- **Use Cases**: Auditing, enforcing constraints, alerts.  

**Example**:  
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER notify_new_prescription  
AFTER INSERT ON Prescription  
FOR EACH ROW  
EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_function();  
```

## [Lesson 12]  
### Key Concepts  

#### **Recursive Queries**  
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: Temporary result sets referenced within a query.  
- **Transitive Closure**: Finds indirect relationships (e.g., organizational hierarchies).  

**Example**:  
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE R AS (  
  SELECT 1 AS n  -- Base case  
  UNION  
  SELECT n + 1 FROM R WHERE n < 10  -- Recursive step  
) SELECT * FROM R;  
```

#### **Advanced Aggregation**  
- **Window Functions**: Perform calculations across related rows (e.g., `RANK()`, `SUM() OVER`).  
- **Grouping Sets**: Aggregate data at multiple levels in one query.  

**Example**:  
```sql
SELECT deptname, AVG(salary)  
FROM instructor  
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((deptname), ());  
```

### Reflection  

This unit deepened my understanding of SQL’s capabilities beyond basic queries. Concepts like joins and views enhanced my ability to write efficient, optimized queries, while integrity constraints emphasized the importance of maintaining data consistency.

Working with triggers and recursive queries was particularly eye-opening. Triggers introduced automation at the database level, and recursive CTEs offered a powerful way to handle hierarchical data without complex logic.

Authorization was one of the more challenging topics, but it highlighted how granular access control can balance security with usability. I now see the value of tools like materialized views for performance and triggers for real-time monitoring.

Overall, this unit has strengthened my ability to design secure, efficient, and scalable database systems—skills I look forward to applying in real-world projects.
